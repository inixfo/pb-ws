# PhoneBay Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the following issues in the PhoneBay e-commerce platform:

### 1. Trending Products Price/Variant Not Updating

**Problem**: When clicking on a trending product from the product page, the prices and variants didn't change until the page was manually refreshed.

**Root Cause**: The `TrendingProductsSection` component was navigating to the product page but not triggering a re-fetch of the product data in the `ProductContext`.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `home/src/screens/ElectronicsProduct/sections/TrendingProductsSection/TrendingProductsSection.tsx`
- Enhanced the `handleProductClick` and `handleAddToCart` functions to:
  - Check if we're already on the same product page
  - Force a refresh using `fetchProduct()` if on the same page
  - Navigate to the new product page if different
- Added proper imports for `useLocation` and `useProduct` context

**Files Modified**:
- `home/src/screens/ElectronicsProduct/sections/TrendingProductsSection/TrendingProductsSection.tsx`

### 2. Filters Not Working on Best Sellers, Today's Deals, New Arrivals Pages

**Problem**: The filter sidebar showed "No categories available" and filters didn't work on these specific pages.

**Root Cause**: The filter data (categories, brands) was not being properly fetched and populated before the products were loaded.

**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced filter data loading in all three pages:
  - `home/src/screens/BestSellers/BestSellers.tsx`
  - `home/src/screens/TodaysDeals/TodaysDeals.tsx`
  - `home/src/screens/NewArrivals/NewArrivals.tsx`
- Improved the loading sequence to:
  - Fetch filter data first
  - Wait for filter data to be available
  - Then fetch products and populate filter options
  - Added fallback logic if filter data fails to load
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `home/src/screens/BestSellers/BestSellers.tsx`
- `home/src/screens/TodaysDeals/TodaysDeals.tsx`
- `home/src/screens/NewArrivals/NewArrivals.tsx`

### 3. Category-Brand Filter Not Working Properly

**Problem**: When clicking on a brand from a category, it showed all products from that brand instead of products from that specific category and brand.

**Root Cause**: The URL parameters for category and brand were not being properly handled in the `ShopCatalog` component.

**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced `home/src/screens/ShopCatalog/ShopCatalog.tsx`
- Improved URL parameter handling to:
  - Prioritize URL parameters over selected filters
  - Properly combine category and brand filters
  - Ensure both category and brand filters are applied when both are present
- Updated the `fetchProducts` function to handle multiple filter scenarios

**Files Modified**:
- `home/src/screens/ShopCatalog/ShopCatalog.tsx`

### 4. Enhanced Keyword-Based Search

**Problem**: The current search only found exact product matches, but you wanted it to search for keywords across all products.

**Root Cause**: The search functionality was limited to exact matches and didn't support keyword-based searching.

**Solution Applied**:
- Enhanced backend search functionality in `backend/products/views.py`:
  - Modified `advanced_search` function to support keyword-based search
  - Split search terms into keywords for comprehensive searching
  - Search across multiple fields: name, description, specifications, category, brand, SKU, model number
  - Maintain exact match prioritization while adding keyword support
- Enhanced `autocomplete` function to provide better suggestions:
  - Added keyword-based product suggestions
  - Include category and brand suggestions
  - Add common search terms from specifications
  - Provide more relevant autocomplete results

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/products/views.py`
