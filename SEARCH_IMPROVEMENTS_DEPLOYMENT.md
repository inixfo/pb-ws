# Search Improvements Deployment Guide

## Dependency Issues Fixed

The following issues were addressed to ensure smooth deployment:

1. **SSLCommerz-Python Dependency Conflict**:
   - Problem: SSLCommerz-python 0.0.7 requires requests==2.22.0, conflicting with Requests==2.32.4
   - Solution: Removed sslcommerz-python from requirements.txt since it's handled separately by the custom install_sslcommerz.py script

2. **Requests Package Version**:
   - Problem: Exact version requirement (Requests==2.32.4) causing conflicts
   - Solution: Changed to flexible version requirement (requests>=2.22.0)

3. **Dockerfile.backend Update**:
   - Problem: Redundant installation of requests package
   - Solution: Removed duplicate requests installation since it's already in requirements.txt

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the search improvements:

1. Use the Docker-based deployment with the fixed dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/pb-ws/deployment && docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. The deployment will:
   - Install fuzzywuzzy and python-Levenshtein for advanced search capabilities
   - Use the custom SSLCommerz installation script to avoid dependency conflicts
   - Apply all database migrations including any needed for search analytics
   - Build the frontend with the new search components

3. After deployment, verify the following features are working:
   - Search autocomplete in the header search bar
   - "Did you mean" suggestions for misspelled searches
   - Exact match prioritization in search results
   - Search analytics data collection in the admin panel

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Docker logs for specific errors:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs backend
   docker-compose logs frontend
   ```

2. Verify fuzzywuzzy was installed correctly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend pip list | grep fuzzy
   ```

3. Test the advanced search API endpoint:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/products/search/?q=test
   ```
