# PhoneBay Fixes Summary v2

## Issues Addressed

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the following issues in the PhoneBay e-commerce platform:

### 1. Trending Products Price/Variant Not Updating

**Problem**: When clicking on a trending product from the product page, the prices and variants didn't change until the page was manually refreshed.

**Root Cause**: The `TrendingProductsSection` component was navigating to the product page but not triggering a complete refresh of the product data.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `home/src/screens/ElectronicsProduct/sections/TrendingProductsSection/TrendingProductsSection.tsx`
- Changed the navigation logic to use `window.location.href` instead of React Router's `navigate`
- Added `window.location.reload()` for same-page navigation to force a complete refresh
- This ensures that when a user clicks on a trending product, the page completely reloads with fresh data

**Files Modified**:
- `home/src/screens/ElectronicsProduct/sections/TrendingProductsSection/TrendingProductsSection.tsx`

### 2. Filters Not Working on Best Sellers, Today's Deals, New Arrivals Pages

**Problem**: The filter sidebar showed "No categories available" and filters didn't work on these specific pages.

**Root Cause**: The filter data was not being properly populated and the filter loading sequence was incorrect.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `home/src/screens/BestSellers/BestSellers.tsx`
- Modified `home/src/screens/TodaysDeals/TodaysDeals.tsx`
- Modified `home/src/screens/NewArrivals/NewArrivals.tsx`
- Fixed the filter data loading sequence to ensure categories and brands are properly populated
- Added explicit population of filter data for the sidebar
- Set default price ranges and filter states
- Simplified the product fetching logic to avoid race conditions

**Files Modified**:
- `home/src/screens/BestSellers/BestSellers.tsx`
- `home/src/screens/TodaysDeals/TodaysDeals.tsx`
- `home/src/screens/NewArrivals/NewArrivals.tsx`

### 3. Category-Brand Filter Not Working Properly for Bikes

**Problem**: When clicking on a brand from a category (especially bikes), it showed all products from that brand instead of products from that specific category and brand.

**Root Cause**: The URL parameter handling in the ShopCatalog component was not properly combining category and brand filters.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `home/src/screens/ShopCatalog/ShopCatalog.tsx`
- Fixed the brand filtering logic in the direct API call
- Ensured that when both category and brand parameters are present, the API call properly filters by both
- Added proper URL encoding for brand parameters
- Fixed the parameter ordering to ensure brand filters are applied correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `home/src/screens/ShopCatalog/ShopCatalog.tsx`

### 4. Enhanced Keyword-Based Search Not Working

**Problem**: The keyword-based search was showing all products instead of filtering by keywords because it was using AND logic instead of OR logic.

**Root Cause**: The search query was using `&` (AND) operator which required ALL keywords to be present, instead of `|` (OR) operator which would match ANY keyword.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `backend/products/views.py`
- Changed the search logic in `advanced_search` function from AND to OR operator
- Fixed the autocomplete function to use OR logic as well
- Now when users search for keywords, it will find products containing ANY of the keywords, not ALL of them
- This makes the search much more flexible and user-friendly

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/products/views.py`

## Technical Details

### Search Logic Changes

**Before (AND logic)**:
```python
search_query &= keyword_query  # Required ALL keywords
```

**After (OR logic)**:
```python
search_query |= keyword_query  # Matches ANY keyword
```

### Navigation Changes

**Before**:
```typescript
navigate(targetPath);  // React Router navigation
```

**After**:
```typescript
window.location.href = targetPath;  // Full page reload
```

### Filter Data Loading

**Before**:
- Complex dependency chain between filter data and product loading
- Race conditions causing empty filter states

**After**:
- Direct filter data loading on component mount
- Immediate population of filter states
- Simplified product loading logic
